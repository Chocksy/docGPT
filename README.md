# docGPT -- Alpha
Python script that generates markdown documentation by scanning a directory of files and sending those to GPT

## How to use
You will need to replace API_KEY and openai with your actual API key and OpenAI Python library.

First, make sure you have the openai library installed by running:

```bash
pip install openai
```

To use the script, run:

```bash
python main.py
```
And enter the directory path when prompted. The script will output the structure of the project, classes, and methods with explanations as requested.
